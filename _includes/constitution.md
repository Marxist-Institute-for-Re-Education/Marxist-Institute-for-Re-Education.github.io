# Article II: Purpose

1. Develop a truly correct Marxist-Leninist line by engaging in a ruthless criticism of all that exists.

2. Combat reactionary trends *within* the working class movement, in order to *unify* the working class movement under the *correct* Marxist-Leninist line.
   1. To isolate or re-educate those who have been influenced by these reactionary trends.
   2. To point out and correct the errors of parties and other organizations.
3. Identify the errors and failures in past communist projects and movements
4. MIRE hopes to one day become large enough that on-the-ground action becomes feasible.
